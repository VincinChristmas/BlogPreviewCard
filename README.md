### What I learned

Challenges on how to get it perfect on any device. When checking it in web developer tools it looks like I am doing a bad job.




### Continued development

I will like more tips on responsive web design. Honestly, I am still a little intimidated to use media queries and not entirely sure when to use them in a mobile first approach.
